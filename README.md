## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

I'm a detail-oriented developer with a passion for creating elegant and effective solutions. My journey into tech is a bit unconventional: I started my career with a degree in Chemical Engineering and a foundation in analytical problem-solving. This background taught me how to break down complex systems, a skill I now apply to architecting front-end systems and designing user-friendly web applications.

For the past 5+ years, I've been honing my skills as a freelance developer, working with a diverse range of clients from small businesses to startups. I thrive on the challenge of turning a client's vision into a reality and have experience with a wide variety of technologies and build systems. I'm always eager to learn and grow, and I'm currently looking for a long-term team environment where I can contribute to larger, more complex projects.
